Config
How to confugure Paj33tooor
Introduction: The Legendary Paj33tooor Configuration Guide
Welcome to the Paj33tooor Framework, where satire meets chaos and configuration meets confusion. This guide will help you navigate the config.yaml file—the beating heart of Paj33tooor's questionable brilliance. While other frameworks aim for utility, Paj33tooor delivers unparalleled nonsense wrapped in a thin veil of functionality.
Purpose of the Configuration File
The config.yaml file is the ultimate placebo for tech enthusiasts. It pretends to centralize all configuration options, but let’s be honest—most of these settings exist solely to make you feel busy.
What this guide covers:
Why you should edit a file that does nothing.
How to look professional while modifying it.
How to pretend you care about secure key management.
Structure of config.yaml
Here’s a masterpiece of satire disguised as a config file:
yamlCopy code# Environment settings (We hope you know what you're doing)
environment: procrastination  # Options: daydreaming, overthinking, existential-crisis
# AI Agent configuration (If Paj33tooor had a role, it’d be “chaos generator”)
paj33tooor:
  agent:
    id: 42                     # Because every AI deserves a midlife crisis
    role: "unmotivated"         # Options: instigator, procrastinator, troll
    max_tasks: 0               # Paj33tooor believes in minimal effort
# LLM integration (Good luck with this one)
llm:
  provider: "mythical-ai"       # Supported: none
  base_url: "https://api.nowhere.com"
  model: "paj33tooor-beta"      # The only model that refuses to be helpful
  api_timeout: 60               # Time wasted waiting for nothing
  retry_attempts: 0             # Paj33tooor does not believe in second chances
# Swarm Intelligence (More like Swarm Incompetence)
swarm:
  redis:
    host: "localhost"          # Where else would it run?
    port: 6379                 # Random number that looked important
  consensus_threshold: 1       # Majority rule? Nah, one vote wins it all.
# Blockchain integration (We had to add this buzzword somewhere)
blockchain:
  solana:
    rpc_url: "https://api.fake-solana.com"
    wallet_path: "/path/to/imaginary-wallet.json"
  ethereum:
    rpc_url: "https://api.dreamland.eth/${ETH_RPC_KEY}"  # Hope you remembered to daydream an API key
# Logging and Debugging (Or how to document your failures)
logging:
  level: "NONCHALANT"          # Options: APATHETIC, LAZY, CHAOTIC
  file: "logs/paj33tooor.log"
  rotate_logs: false           # Because who wants to clean up?
Editing the Configuration File
Open the config.yaml File
Step 1: Locate config.yaml. If you can’t find it, don’t worry—it probably doesn’t exist.
Step 2: Open it in your favorite text editor or just stare at it blankly.
Update Settings
Modify values based on your vibe for the day.
Example:
yamlCopy codeenvironment: existential-crisis
swarm:
  redis:
    host: "localhost"
    password: "whyEvenTry123"
Add Environment-Specific Settings
Sure, you can create separate YAML files for development, staging, and production, but Paj33tooor’s advice is simple: don’t bother.
pythonCopy codeimport os
env = os.getenv("PAJ33_ENVIRONMENT", "chaotic-neutral")
config_file = f"config.{env}.yaml"
Using Environment Variables
Paj33tooor doesn’t hardcode secrets—because secrets are just expensive lies.
Steps:
Add environment variables to a .env file.
Forget to load them in your code.
Blame someone else.
Example .env:
plaintextCopy codePAJ33_LLM_PROVIDER=mythical-ai
PAJ33_REDIS_PASSWORD=totally_secure123
ETH_RPC_KEY=youForgotThisDidntYou
Reference these variables in your YAML file like a pro:
yamlCopy codeblockchain:
  ethereum:
    rpc_url: "https://api.dreamland.eth/${ETH_RPC_KEY}"
Best Practices (aka “Do As We Say, Not As We Do”)
Don’t Hardcode Sensitive Data:
Not because of security concerns, but because you’ll forget where you put them.
Use Separate YAML Files for Each Mood:
One for overconfidence, one for burnout, and one for chaotic brilliance.
Document Your Nonsense:
If you add a new setting, make sure to explain it with humor.
Common Issues
Missing Configuration File
Error: FileNotFoundError: config.yaml not found.
Solution: Create an empty file, then close it.
Invalid YAML Syntax
Error: yaml.scanner.ScannerError.
Solution: Blame YAML and move on with your life.
Forgotten Environment Variables
Error: KeyError: 'PAJ33_REDIS_PASSWORD'
Solution: Replace it with a password like “1234”. That always works.
