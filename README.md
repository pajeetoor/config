# Paj33tooor Framework: The Legendary Configuration Guide ü§°

Welcome to the Paj33tooor Framework, where satire meets chaos and configuration meets confusion. This guide will help you navigate the `config.yaml` file‚Äîthe beating heart of Paj33tooor's questionable brilliance. While other frameworks aim for utility, Paj33tooor delivers unparalleled nonsense wrapped in a thin veil of functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Purpose of the Configuration File

The `config.yaml` file is the ultimate placebo for tech enthusiasts. It pretends to centralize all configuration options, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîmost of these settings exist solely to make you feel busy.

### What this guide covers:
- Why you should edit a file that does nothing.
- How to look professional while modifying it.
- How to pretend you care about secure key management.

## üìú Structure of `config.yaml`

Here‚Äôs a masterpiece of satire disguised as a config file:

```yaml
# Environment settings (We hope you know what you're doing)
environment: procrastination  # Options: daydreaming, overthinking, existential-crisis

# AI Agent configuration (If Paj33tooor had a role, it‚Äôd be ‚Äúchaos generator‚Äù)
paj33tooor:
  agent:
    id: 42                     # Because every AI deserves a midlife crisis
    role: "unmotivated"         # Options: instigator, procrastinator, troll
    max_tasks: 0               # Paj33tooor believes in minimal effort

# LLM integration (Good luck with this one)
llm:
  provider: "mythical-ai"       # Supported: none
  base_url: "https://api.nowhere.com"
  model: "paj33tooor-beta"      # The only model that refuses to be helpful
  api_timeout: 60               # Time wasted waiting for nothing
  retry_attempts: 0             # Paj33tooor does not believe in second chances

# Swarm Intelligence (More like Swarm Incompetence)
swarm:
  redis:
    host: "localhost"          # Where else would it run?
    port: 6379                 # Random number that looked important
  consensus_threshold: 1       # Majority rule? Nah, one vote wins it all.

# Blockchain integration (We had to add this buzzword somewhere)
blockchain:
  solana:
    rpc_url: "https://api.fake-solana.com"
    wallet_path: "/path/to/imaginary-wallet.json"
  ethereum:
    rpc_url: "https://api.dreamland.eth/${ETH_RPC_KEY}"  # Hope you remembered to daydream an API key

# Logging and Debugging (Or how to document your failures)
logging:
  level: "NONCHALANT"          # Options: APATHETIC, LAZY, CHAOTIC
  file: "logs/paj33tooor.log"
  rotate_logs: false           # Because who wants to clean up?
